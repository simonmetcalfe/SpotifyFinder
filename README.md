### Values Specific to your Instance
The app needs a few values that are specific to your instance to run. You will need to edit 
sfCfg.json. This file is in the main project dir.  In sfCfg.json there are 9 config params. 
You must set the first 3 values, the fourth value is already set for you, and the last 5 values
are optionally. 

    "local_server_127_0_0_1":   
    {
        "sFlaskAppSecretKey":     "your flask secret key",
        "sSpotifyClientId":       "your spotify client id",
        "sSpotifyClientSecret":   "your spotify client secret",
        "sSpotifyRedirectUri":    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/oAuthCallback",
        "sMySqlHost":             "",  # optional
        "sMySqlUser":             "",  # optional
        "sMySqlPwRoot":           "",  # optional
        "sMySqlPwUser":           "",  # optional
        "sMySqlDbName":           ""   # optional
    }

You will need to go to the Spotify Developer website, https://developer.spotify.com/, 
to create a Spotify App which will provide you with a spotify client id and a spotify 
client secret, be sure to set the spotify redirect Uri to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/oAuthCallback"
in the spotify dev console for the spotify app you created.  Put the sSpotifyClientId
and sSpotifyClientSecret from the Spotify dev console into the above json dict. MySql
is optional so you can just leave the MySql values empty/blank.

### MySql is Optional
This website works fine w/o a MySql server/db.  If you leave sMySqlDbName, in sfCfg.json, empty you 
will not need to setup a MySql server/db. You will still need to import the Flask-MySqlDb package 
into your IDE.
